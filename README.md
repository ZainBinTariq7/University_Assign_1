Project Title: Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment
Overview
This project involves data analysis and visualization using Python. The objective is to explore relationships within a dataset, perform various statistical analyses, and visualize key insights using matplotlib and seaborn. The results will be presented in a PDF report alongside the code in this repository.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [source link or site, e.g., Kaggle/Worldbank]. The dataset contains data about companies, including their revenues, countries, and other relevant attributes.

Objectives
The assignment focuses on:

Analyzing the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
Visualizing distributions and comparisons using bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps.
Demonstrating proficiency with data manipulation, cleaning, and statistical analysis.
Visualization Details
Top 10 Companies by Revenue: A horizontal bar chart that shows the top 10 companies ranked by revenue.
Country Distribution: A pie chart visualizing the distribution of companies by country.
Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap to identify correlations between numeric features in the dataset.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
Install the necessary libraries with:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
Usage
Clone the repository.
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file Zain_Assign_3_(1).ipynb in an environment that supports Jupyter notebooks.
The notebook performs data loading, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.
The results are displayed in the form of visualizations and printed statistics.
Structure
Zain_Assign_3_(1).ipynb: Main notebook file containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
README.md: Description of the project, objectives, and usage instructions.
Report.pdf: Final report containing plots, explanations, and analysis.
Results and Insights
This analysis provides insights into:

The top 10 companies based on revenue.
The geographic distribution of companies.
Correlations among various numerical fields.
The findings are displayed in both the notebook and the report file.
